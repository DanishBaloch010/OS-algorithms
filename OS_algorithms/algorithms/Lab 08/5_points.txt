Threads are subset of processes. the subsets of processes are smallest unit of processing that can be performed in an OS.

Threads are light weight processes. A single process can create multiple threads.

Threads share their adresses space while processes have seperate address spaces.

Multi threading means two or more threads running concurrently where each thread is handling a different task.
This concurrent manner is used for better resource optimization and centraliztion.

The join function is used to halt the execution of main thread until its child thread is done execution.
The detach funtion is used to deatache a thread from parent thread. it allows the main thread and child process to execute independetly.
