 This repository contains OS algorithms, mainly RR, priority scheduling, memory management algorithms, Bankers algorithm and producer-consumer problem implementation in C++

Lab code prior to Lab-3 is in the bash script repository (because they are bash scripts assignments so i have separated them)
